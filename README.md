# Learn_Bicep


## what is Bicep?

* Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. 
* In a Bicep file, you define the infrastructure you want to deploy to Azure, and then use that file throughout the development lifecycle to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. 
* Your resources are deployed in a consistent manner

* Treating your _infrastructure as code_ enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your deployments more consistent and repeatable.

* Bicep provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse. 

* Bicep offers a first-class authoring experience for your infrastructure-as-code solutions in Azure.

* If you're familiar with the JSON syntax for writing Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), you'll find that Bicep provides a more concise syntax and improved type safety. In fact, Bicep files compile to standard ARM templates.
